    "speech": "Welcome to Cockroach Hiss! Here is how to play. You see a big Madagascar hissing cockroach on the screen. Tap the cockroach's head to make it hiss. Each hiss moves the cockroach a little bit toward the toilet on the other side of the screen. Every hiss earns you 10 points. If you tap quickly, you get combo bonus points! Keep tapping the head until the cockroach reaches the toilet. When it gets there, it will let out a big fart and you win the game! Try to win with as few taps as possible to get 3 stars. Good luck!"
